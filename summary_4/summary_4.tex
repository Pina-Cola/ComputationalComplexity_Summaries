\section*{Summary: Lecture 4}

Summary for the chapter \textit{7.3} from page 150 on. \cite{book}

\subsection*{Asymmetry of non-deterministism}

Asymmetry of nondeterministic acceptance:
\begin{itemize}
\item Example: find out if a formula $\varphi$ is satisfiable:
\begin{itemize}
\item choose truth values for the variables nondeterministically
\item check if they make $\varphi$ become true
\end{itemize}
\item seems to be unpractical so check whether $\varphi$ is not satisfiable, because each option would have to be checked then
\end{itemize}

to check if formular is non satisfiable \\
question whether NP $=$ coNP \\

similar isuues is non-deterministic space: \\
write down $n$ nodes on a ... non-det. will succeed if it is possible \\
to show that it is impossible to ... in SPACE was unsolved until the 80s \\
$h$ for function (yes or no or $h$?) \\
$h$ is yes \\
everything that fails stops in stae with no \\

\section*{Immerman-Szelepsc√®nyi}

how many distinct nodes can be reached in a graph if you start from a graph $x$ \\
$s(0)$ will contain node 1 and $s(1)$ will contain all neighbours of 1 \\
we will have actual names \\
4 nested for loops and algorithm happens in the middle \\
outer for loop: \\
computes number of nodes reachable from initial node (for $k$ steps with $k$ as the interative thingy in the for loop) \\
in each step we override the previous set with the next one because we only have limited space \\
second loop: \\
we get how far we got in the previous steps and sum up how far we can get (because we can get previous set size?) \\
third loop: \\
the actual magic happens here: checking something \\
Aux sounds like a port for headphones \\
return no when all guesses were correct? we remember solution that we were supposed to reach beforehand \\
it requires thinking \\
we cant even mark nodes (would use linear space) but with determinism we get it into $\log n$ (?) \\
% U E A I O
Algorithm (2) slides seems to be important

NL $=$ nondeterministic logarithmic space \\
little bit of stuff between log n and constand but no interesting stuff \\
